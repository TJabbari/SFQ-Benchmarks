# SFQ-Benchmarks
The lack of SFQ specific benchmark systems complicates the development and evaluation of these SFQ design flows. This limitation is particularly relevant to the development of physical design tools since existing CMOS benchmark systems are not easily adapted to support SFQ technology. Due to the gate-level pipelining inherent to SFQ logic, path balancing using D flip flops is required to ensure consistent logic depth and correct operation.
Here we present an algorithm to convert CMOS benchmark circuits into SFQ technology, producing SFQ circuits with over 100,000 logic gates.
The placement of cells and PTL rows in the SFQ-based B09 benchmark circuit based on the MIT LL SFQ5ee technology is shown in the following figure.
